Version 4

- fixed digi samples handling
- added "as is" support for first SID ($EE) command

Notes:

1. This player written by Jochen Hippel uses the best known (high quality)
   Atari ST soundchip emulator on the Amiga.

2. The following Atari ST song formats from Jochen Hippel's TFMXMMTEX-Editor
   are supported:

   - TFMX (The Final Musicsystem eXtended)
   - MMME (Mad Max Music Editor)
   - COSO (COmpressed SOng) for TFMX and MMME songfiles
   - MMME-MMME (Mad Max Music Editor) with SID (first version only).

3. Default file prefixes for two files (with external samples) format are:

   Songdata - HST. (for example: HST.WingsOfDeath 1)
   Samples  - SMP. (for example: SMP.WingsOfDeath 1)

   You can use also "SMP.set" for the sample file name.

4. Due to several different formats of TFMX replayers on the Atari ST,
   the original PC relative replay code is often required in front
   of the module (especially for digi songs) in order to be correctly
   recognised and played. For example, Turrican and Turrican II songs.
   All Jochen Hippel songs in original (unchanged) format from the Wanted
   Team page were tested.

5. Sometimes it's better to disable the Converter Genie in the DeliTracker
   Genies menu, because some Jochen Hippel ST songs in TFMX format can be
   played wrong.

6. If you know of or have any other Jochen Hippel mods that are not 
   available on the Wanted Team page, please contact Wanted Team. 
   Both Amiga and Atari ST files are welcome.

7. ModuleInfo works/looks better for EaglePlayer 1.54.

8. The loaded module (for safety) must always be at least as many bytes
   long as the calculated size. This is why some modules will give you
   an error with this player. Some original songs are saved two bytes
   too short. If this is the case, you can add a few (2-30) empty bytes
   at end if you have the original songs or re-rip the tune again.
