Now what about that future?
==================================
Is there really a future in this
world? Is there any reason why we've
done this for you, all for free?
You know, don't you? These hours and
hours consumed by this stupid Amiga,
are they really worth it?
 We've only got one answer, and that is:
... that is:
       Nope!
This is the very, VERY, last thing you
will see from us. From now and on, our
lives come in the first place, above all
this shitty programming we've been doing
for the last ten years.
So, this text should be some kind of
sad partingstory, but we do not look
at it as a sad thing to do. We always
wanted to do something nobody else
dared to do, and the most astonishing
thing is that we think we managed! 
I do not normally use dirty language,
but in this case I have to. This
fucking musicdisk has taken me over 20
months to complete, and is it really
worth it? No, No, No, No, not at all!
But it's all my fault, I started it,
I had to finish it, and it would have
been finished long ago if it wasn't for
one simple rule: It must work!
If it doesn't work on your computer,
DON'T TELL ME!!! I don't want to know.
The last eight months I've spent
correcting bugs and including new
bugs. I can't really understand why I
didn't follow a good friends hint:
To create a basic-program that
randomizes some 100kb of memory,
and then checks if the randomized
numbers would turn up to be a
musicdisk by Mahoney & Kaktus.
Ok, the possibility that 100000
randomised bytes would be a
working musicdisk isn't very
big, but it would still be a much
more comfortable way of doing this
musicdisk. Some day I will try it out!
Anyway, the summer is soon over,
and whenever the sun was shining,
you couldn't find me in front of a
computer. That is the main reason
for this little delay of about
a year. The original release-date
was October 1990. I think I failed!
What happens to Mahoney & Kaktus?
Well, do you know? I don't ...
I (Mahoney) have recently taken over
the school-magazine at our school,
Polhemskolan in Lund, together with
a couple of friends (Guts & Flex in
Paradise, Larsson, Pjeter, Erik and
Boubi/Target) and we have also started
a club of humor. That is my future.
Kaktus has been working at a local
food-store moving bananas and apples,
and has all together an all too
exciting life, thereby forgetting
a lot of other things, for instance
his little computer. Those few days
he discovers it in his cupboard he
spends making mathemagic. Not much
to be done there!
So, the less I type here, the
faster this disk will be released.
If you want to check out what
mathemagic is, watch the reset-part
of this musicdisk.
Thank you for watching, hope you
like what you see, because we sure do!
Have a noise day!
Mahoney & Kaktus
the 30th of September 1991.
