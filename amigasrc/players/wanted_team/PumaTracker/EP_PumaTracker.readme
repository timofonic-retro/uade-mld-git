Notes:

1. The "PumaTracker" soundformat was created by Jean-Charles Meyrignac for
   the Atari ST and ported to the Amiga by Pierre-Eric Loriaux.

2. For correct playback of some "PumaTracker" modules from the Atari ST
   (for example, from "Toki ST") you must disable the 4th (last) voice in
   the EaglePlayer GUI because otherwise you might hear some wrong sounds
   (Atari ST replay can handle three voices only).

3. You can choose your preferred player version for use with EP 2.00+.

   The sound output of the Amplifier version in the Fast RAM Amplifier mode
   is sometimes very poor. I'm not sure why but perhaps it is another EP2
   bug. Sources for both player versions are available on the WT page.

4. The loaded module must always be at least as many bytes long as the
   calculated size. This is why some modules will give you an error
   with this player.
