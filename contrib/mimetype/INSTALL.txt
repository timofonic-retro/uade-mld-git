Opendesktop Mimetype (audio/x-amiga)

here you can find Filename patterns (aka Mimetype) for Amiga prefixes like mdat.*, mod.* and in case you renamed your files 
for PC/Dos suffixes for easier association with a dedicated player like uade123.

The mimetypes were tested with Dolphin/KDE4 but should work with any file manager following the opendesktop secification.


Installation:
if it doesn't already exits, create following folderstructure at in your home directory:
$HOME/.local/share/mime/audio/

copy the x-amiga.xml and x-amiga_pcsuffix to $HOME/.local/share/mime/audio/
Restart your Desktop environment.
